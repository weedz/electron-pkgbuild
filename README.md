# electron-bin

Based on <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/electron24-bin>.

`electron[major]` will be installed in `/usr/bin/electron[major]`. Easiest is to symlink something like `/home/user/bin/electron` to `/usr/bin/electron[major]`. And make sure you have both `/home/user/bin` and `/usr/bin` in your `$PATH`.
